# my_first_game

This is my first game fully made in Python using pygame. Later, the text may change, but for now it's worth telling a little about the game.
A simple game where you steer the ship on 'a' and 'd' and shoot with the mouse. The game will get harder over time, but you too can get stronger.

Important! For the game to work (probably) all picture and sound files must be in the same folder with the code file!

(If I can learn how to collect working exe files, then in the future everything will be easier.)
